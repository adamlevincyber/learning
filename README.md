I am always finding methods to optimize my ability to learn new things. Over the past year, I have gone from knowing barely anything about cyber to exploring the areas of low level exploitation, reverse engineering, and malware analysis! It's always very exciting to look back at previous months and see how little I knew compared to now.

## Main Topics
- Binary exploitation
- Malware development
- Understanding technical writeups relating to low-level exploitation
- Solidifying programming knowledge

## Certifications:
The advanced technical certifications that I am interested in will take lots of studying over months of hard work. School has been one of the limiting factors for my certification progression. I strongly believe that certifications are beneficial to extending your overall knowledge, although I do not believe in mindlessly going for every certification out there. Example: "If I study for months and take a certification what will I actually be getting out of this?" I would also argue that if you are truly passionate about a subject, go for it! For most students out there it is extremely difficult to find the time to put into new certs.

Below are a list of certifications I will earn when time allows.
- Offensive Security Exploit Developer (OSED)
- eLearnSecurity Certified Reverse Engineer (eCRE)
- eLearnSecurity Certified Malware Analysis Professional (eCMAP)
